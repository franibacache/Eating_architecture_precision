* Data cleaning â€“ Baseline cleaning of ALSPAC diet dataset. Some further cleaning was performed later for some of the analyses and specified in the respective script.
*NOTE: AT= precise times; MS: broad times.

*** Create indicator variable where indicator=0 means that row/instance has a non-missing AT; indicator=1 will indicate a row with missing AT.

order aln qlet id indicator _showme_1 total_rows interesting_rows totally_missing_rows proportion_interesting proportion_totally_missing _showme_2 tot_rows_day missing_rows_day

*Creating new variable with the proportion of missingness per day (per person)

order aln qlet id indicator _showme_1 total_rows interesting_rows totally_missing_rows proportion_interesting proportion_totally_missing _showme_2 tot_rows_day missing_rows_day proportion_miss_day


*Create indicator variables to know the people with completely missing AT data (this will include some of the situations where MS=. & AT=.). Then drop those people from this dataset to now end up with only people with partially missing AT data. 
 bysort id: egen totmissAT = total(fa07time_coded==.)

*Dropping rows (and people) with completely missing AT data.
   drop if proportion_missAT==1  /*(135,269 observations deleted)*/

* Dropped IDs where [MS=AT & that are left with an eating frequency of 1 (or 1.33, 1.67)] for AT (for example, they have only one exact time/data recorded for a time slot, which is not true, it's just that all of their other AT times are missing. These IDs have been previously identified when creating the EAVs.
